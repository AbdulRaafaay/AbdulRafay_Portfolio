  bio: `I am a passionate and curious cybersecurity student who thrives on learning new things — especially in ethical hacking and penetration testing. I constantly seek out opportunities to deepen my technical knowledge, challenge myself with real-world labs, and grow through hands-on experience.

Currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate alongside the TryHackMe Junior Penetration Tester path, I am actively building a strong foundation in offensive security. My next goal is to dive into red teaming through TryHackMe and beyond, expanding my skills in advanced adversarial tactics and system exploitation.

I believe in learning by doing, and I approach cybersecurity with a mindset of continuous improvement, ethical responsibility, and a drive to contribute to secure digital systems.`,
