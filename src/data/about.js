	fullName: "Abdul Rafay",

	bio: `I am a dedicated and results-driven Cybersecurity student from FAST NUCES Islamabad, specializing in **Intelligent Security Automation (SOAR) and Network Defense**. I thrive on translating theoretical knowledge into verifiable, hands-on architectural solutions. My core expertise lies at the intersection of network security and artificial intelligence.

My practical experience includes designing and deploying an **End-to-End SOC Automation pipeline** using the Wazuh, TheHive, Cortex, and MISP stack, successfully **reducing incident response time to under 10 seconds**. I am currently engaged in research on **Machine Learning for Database Intrusion Detection**, utilizing advanced methods like SQL fingerprinting and TSASM clustering to detect anomalous activity with a **91.90% recall rate**.

I am committed to **continuous learning**, pursuing advanced topics through TryHackMe and Google certifications. My goal is to advance into research-driven security engineering, leveraging expertise in Python, Linux, and network protocols to build highly resilient, data-driven security systems and accelerate threat prevention.`,
